# Trivia Quiz
This is a jQuery/JavaScript based timed trivia game.  Trivia data is stored in a JSON file.

## TODO:  
* Make radio choice the 'answer' click event, instead of separate button.
* Display running count of correct answers and questions left.
* Remove HTML template placeholder junk.
* Style HTML page.
* Find themed images for display.
* Add button to reset game.

## Future enhancement ideas
* multiple trivia topic selections, stored in separate json files.
* add a difficulty that gives more or less time
* set time based on the number of questions available
